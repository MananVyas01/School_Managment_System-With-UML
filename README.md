The architecture of the School Management System is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. It follows best practices of object-oriented design and modern C++ development. The system is divided into several key components:

- **Core Classes**: Fundamental classes like `Student`, `Teacher`, `Course`, and `Classroom` that represent the main entities of the system.
- **Reporting Module**: A dedicated module for generating reports and analytics.
- **Configuration Module**: Manages system configuration and settings.
- **Testing Framework**: A built-in unit testing framework to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Core Classes Overview

```cpp
class Student {
public:
    Student(int id, const std::string& name, int age);
    
    // Getters
    int getId() const;
    const std::string& getName() const;
    int getAge() const;
    
    // Course Management
    void enrollInCourse(std::shared_ptr<Course> course);
    bool isEnrolledIn(int courseId) const;
    
    // Attendance
    void markAttendance(const std::string& courseName, bool isPresent);
    double getAttendancePercentage(const std::string& courseName) const;
};
```

#### Teacher Class
```cpp
class Teacher {
public:
    Teacher(int id, const std::string& name, const std::string& subject);
    
    // Course Assignment
    void assignToCourse(std::shared_ptr<Course> course);
    bool isAssignedTo(int courseId) const;
    int getAssignedCoursesCount() const;
    
    // Information Management
    void setDepartment(const std::string& department);
    const std::string& getDepartment() const;
};
```

#### Course Class
```cpp
class Course {
public:
    Course(int id, const std::string& name, int maxStudents = 50);
    
    // Student Management
    bool enrollStudent(std::shared_ptr<Student> student);
    bool isStudentEnrolled(int studentId) const;
    bool isFull() const;
    
    // Teacher Assignment
    void assignTeacher(std::shared_ptr<Teacher> teacher);
    std::shared_ptr<Teacher> getAssignedTeacher() const;
    
    // Attendance Tracking
    void recordAttendance(int studentId, const std::string& date, bool isPresent);
    double getStudentAttendancePercentage(int studentId) const;
};
```
